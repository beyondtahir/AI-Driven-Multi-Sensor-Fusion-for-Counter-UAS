The rapid proliferation of small unmanned aerial systems (sUAS) has created unprecedented challenges for national defense. Conventional radar or single-modality detection pipelines are brittle, 
often failing under clutter, low signal-to-noise conditions, or electronic warfare (EW) jamming. This research explores a novel, AI-driven multi-sensor fusion framework for counter-UAS (C-UAS) applications, 
with specific emphasis on defense requirements in Pakistan. By integrating electro-optical/infrared (EO/IR), radar, radio-frequency (RF), and acoustic sensors, we propose a fusion baseline that leverages 
feature-level and object-level strategies to ensure robustness against adversarial interference. We design experiments simulating noise and jamming, and evaluate trade-offs between detection accuracy and latency. 
Using datasets such as Anti-UAV and Anti-UAV410, alongside a controlled ethical dataset, we introduce new performance metrics: time-to-detect (TTD), false alarm rate (FAR) under cost, and operator workload impact. 
Results demonstrate that our AI-driven pipeline achieves faster detection and lower false alarms, particularly in contested EW environments. Deployment realities, including edge compute, bandwidth constraints, 
and explainability, are analyzed. We conclude with a roadmap for open benchmarks under EW, ethical governance of defense AI, and sim-to-real transfer protocols. This research offers a scalable framework for
next-generation C-UAS systems, positioning Pakistan at the forefront of AI-enabled defense.
